# Image-compression_using_neural_networks
This project converts an RGB image (3 dimensional matrix image) to an extremely low number of neurons and then regenerate the picture from these neurons. It uses a neural network architecture called an AutoEncder, it consists of two simillar bur reversed components called an Encoder. you can see the architecture below.
for the decoder we use Convolutional Neural Network and maxpooling at first and then we flatten this archictecture to a feed forward neural network inorder to reach maximum compression possible. and then we do the same thing reversed for the decoder.
the middle hidden layer between the encoder and the decoder is called the latent space. it's the neurons that represents the image and store it's features. we can utilize this project in the places of poor internet connection where the sender can have the encoder to compress the image to it's latent space and send it to the receiver who decompress these images using the decoder he have. you can see examples of compressed images and it's original copy here.
