# Image-compression_using_neural_networks
This project converts an RGB image (3-dimensional matrix image) to an extremely low number of neurons and then regenerates the picture from these neurons. It uses a neural network architecture called an AutoEncder, It consists of two similar but reversed components called an Encoder and a decoder. you can see the architecture below.
for the encoder, we use a Convolutional Neural Network and max-pooling at first and then we flatten this architecture to a feed-forward neural network in order to reach the maximum compression possible. and then we do the same thing reversed for the decoder.
the middle hidden layer between the encoder and the decoder is called the latent space. it's the neurons that represent the image and store its features. we can utilize this project in places of poor internet connection where the sender can have the encoder compress the image to its latent space and send it to the receiver who decompresses these images using the decoder he has. you can see examples of compressed images and their original copies here.
